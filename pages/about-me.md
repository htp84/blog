Hi, I'm Henric Sundberg and this is my personal blog. I'm a big fan of data and different things you can do with data. So, this blog will mostly be about things you do in the data pipeline, e.g. Get, Clean, Analyze, Present.
<br>
This blog will work as a personal notebook. However, you may find some of my posts useful if you are interested in data.
<br>I am a business controller/developer with vast Business Intelligence experience. I have experience in all steps of the data pipeline(Define, Find, Get, Verify, Clean, Analyze, Present) using Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, jupyter lab), C#, Power BI, R (tidyverse), SQL, Excel (PowerPivot, Power Query) and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).
